## Data


The solar system is not in scale because, when attempting to display it at its true scale, it becomes difficult to show all the planets in a single view. 

The vastness of space makes it impossible to accurately depict the distances between the planets in a single image or animation. 


To give a sense of the relative size and distances in the solar system, it been used a reduced, approximated scale, which can make the planets appear closer together than they actually are. 

In this way, it is possible to view the entire solar system in a single scene, but it is important to note that the scale is not accurate.


You can get an impression of the actual scale of solar system at [If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html).
